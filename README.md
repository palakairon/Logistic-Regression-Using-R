# Logistic-Regression-Using-R
Logistic Regression is one among the machine learning algorithms used for solving classification problems. it is used to estimate probability whether an instance belongs to a category or not. If the estimated probability is bigger than threshold, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class, alternatively it predicts that it doesnâ€™t belong to the category as shown in fig 1. This makes it a binary classifier. Logistic regression is employed where the worth of the variable is 0/1, true/false or yes/no.
